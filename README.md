# Car Price Prediction : 

This a simple car price prediction model that I build for demonstration purpuose to the GDSC members. 

I found the dataset on Kaggle, I took a lot of techniques from kaggle notebooks to build the model and deployed the model using flask. 

For the front-end I have used <b>HTML and CSS<b> 

This is how it looks and works 
<p align = 'center' >
    <img alt = 'home_imge' width = 550px src = 'results/car_price_prediction.gif'>
</p>
